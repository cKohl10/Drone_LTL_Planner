This folder contains all of the software used for Gazebo simulation using ArduCopter, MAVROS, and MAVLink. It was built in a custom catkin on a Ubuntu 20 device running gazebo11. If you truly wish to run this software, all CMake files, bash scripts, and the LTLForest.cpp GNC script will need to be changed to match your version and correct the file path of references.
All needed software will run using bash LTLStart.sh, this will rebuild the workspace, open a roslaunch gazebo sim, connect to the SITL through MAVLink, open MAVROS to communicate GNC scripts, then run the GNC script LTLForest.cpp.
